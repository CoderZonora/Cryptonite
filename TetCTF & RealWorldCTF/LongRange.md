Got a flash dump and a .wav file in the attachment. On analyzing the dump it showed up as a DOS executable but could no further with it.

Also the name of the wave file **'486_375MHz-1MSps-1MHz.wav'** was interesting as it specified some parameters which might be useful. 

After fiddling around with it and trying the normal methods like LSB,waveform analyzer,strings nothing worked. Then got a hint that maybe it was a LoRa challenge. Tried to run gr-lora on it and got 
some output but could not proceed further.
